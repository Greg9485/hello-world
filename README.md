# hello-world
first github repository

Hey, 

My name is Greg. I'm pretty new to coding but I've been playing around with C++, C#, and Python, as well as HTML & CSS. I'm currently going for my Bachelor's Degree in Software Development with Western Governor's University. I'm just on here trying to learn as much as possible!
